  <h2 class="section-header">Generation</h2>
  <p class="lead">

  In this section the overall algorithm for generating the terrain is described in
  detail. Terrain generation can be broken down into three steps:
  <ul class="lead num-list">
    <li>Heightmap generation</li>
    <li>Heightmap blending</li>
    <li>Geometry generation</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="lead">
  Heightmaps are used to create the models of the terrain that is split into terrain patches. These are smaller sections of the terrain that fits together without any visual artifacts. To make them do this we have to blend the raw heightmaps with all adjacent heightmaps.
  When this is done, the model for the terrain can be generated using the values in the heightmap scaled with an amplitude.
  </p>
  </p>

  <p class="lead">
  The terrain is generated in runtime depending on the movement of the camera.
  When moving around, the following algorithm is used:
  </p>

  <ol class="lead" style="padding-bottom: 40px;">
    <li>A row/column of new terrain patches are generated on a separate thread. The generated terrain patches are placed inside the
    NxN-grid in the moving direction.</li>
    <li>Blending heightmaps</li>
    <li>Terrain patches in the opposite of the moving direction are removed, making
    our grid retain its NxN size.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 class="space-header">Heightmap generation</h2>
  <p class="lead">
  Heightmaps are generated using two different methods: value noise and perlin noise. These gives a different look of the terrain as is shown in the section below.

      <h3 class="featurette-heading">Value noise</h3>

      <p class="lead">
      In value noise, the grid values are random numbers evenly distributed
      between zero and one. Value noise then uses cubic interpolation for pixel
      calculations.

      <h3 class="featurette-heading">Perlin noise</h3>
      <p class="lead">
      In perlin noise, each grid point instead generates a gradient. The gradients
      consists of two random numbers to represent a vector. Each grid
      point then calculates a grid value for each pixel through the scalar product
      between its gradient and the vector to that pixel. Perlin noise then uses
      linear interpolation for pixel calculations.
