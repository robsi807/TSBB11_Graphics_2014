  Rendering has been large part of this project as we wanted to, not only, generate the model for the terrain, but also make it look as natural as possible.<br />

      <p class="lead">
      The terrain is rendered by using phong shading together with a procedural
      texturing method. The texturing varies using three different textures: one
      grass texture and two rock textures. The shader weights between drawing rock
      or grass depending on how much the terrain is tilting. Flat terrain gets textured
      as grass and tilting terrain gets textured as rock. The shader then decides which
      of the two rock textures to draw depending on low frequency noise, to get some
      variations in the terrain.

      <p class="lead">
      Distance fog is a visual effect that is used to hide the end of the viewing frustum
      when drawing a large world. Objects like terrain or trees that are far away fades
      into the skybox instead of suddenly disappearing. This is done in the fragment
      shader using the length of a vector from the camera position to the fragment
      that is drawn. Depending on the length of the vector, the objectsâ€™ color are then
      slowly interpolated into the skyboxs color. The amount of fog that is added is
      calculated using cosine interpolation which gives a more natural fade then linear
      interpolation.
